# boilerplate-react
An scaffold for web development using: Bootstrap, MVC with React and Backbone, Less and other Javascript good friends.

The MVC is done as follow:
- Model: Backbone Models and Collections are being used together with React-Backone for the Event handling and Views refreshing
- View: Pure React Views here
- Controller: I would say this layer's name should be 'Router'. And this is being done through React-Router
